//Build a structure in main.h capable of representing a 2D vector called Vector2. Then,
//write a function in main.h called GetDistanceBetweenPoints which:
//
//- Takes two Vector2 instances via parameter
//- Returns the Euclidean distance between the two points, as a float.
//
//Euclidean distance calculation is used throughout games programming, for several
//different purposes. 

//You should then highlight the function working correctly. The code below
//will prompt the user for an X and Y for two vectors.
    //You should then build two Vector2s from the given x and y components, and show
    //the calculated distance between each point.
